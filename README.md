## Technologies Used

### Hardware Components
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11/DHT22)  
- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32)  
- Jumper wires & Breadboard  

### Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE  
- Embedded C / C++  
- Serial Monitor / IoT Dashboard (if used)

## System Working

1. Sensors collect soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data  
2. Microcontroller processes the sensor data  
3. Data is displayed on the serial monitor / dashboard  
4. Threshold-based logic helps in irrigation decision-making  
5. System continuously updates values for real-time monitoring
